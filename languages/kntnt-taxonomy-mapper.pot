"Enter a JSON object which consists of key/value-pairs where each key is the "
"name of a source taxonomy and each value is another JSON object, which "
"consists of key/value-pairs where each key is the name of a term in the "
"source taxonomy and each value is another JSON object, which consists of "
"key/value-pairs where each key is the name of a destination taxonomy and "
"each value is a JSON array, which consists of the names of terms in the "
"destination taxonomy. This describes a relationship from terms in the source "
"taxonomies to terms in the destination taxonomies. Every time a specified "
"term in the source taxonomy is added to or deleted from a post, the mapped "
"taxonomies will be updated accordingly to the map. The same taxonomy must "
"not be used both as source and destination as that can result in an infinite "
"loop."
